Spglib is a library for finding and handling crystal symmetries
written in C. There are the [python](python-interface.md),
{ref}`fortran, rust, and ruby <interfaces>` interfaces.

The detailed algorithm of spglib is described the following text:

- "$\texttt{Spglib}$: a software library for crystal symmetry search", Atsushi
  Togo, Kohei Shinohara, and Isao Tanaka, Sci. Technol. Adv. Mater., Meth. 4,
  2384822-2384836 (2024)
  \[[link-sg](https://doi.org/10.1080/27660400.2024.2384822)\]
- "Algorithms for magnetic symmetry operation search and identification of
  magnetic space group from magnetic crystal structure", Kohei Shinohara,
  Atsushi Togo, and Isao Tanaka, Acta Cryst. A 79, 390-398 (2023)

## Requirements

- C standard: As of version 2.1.0, Spglib explicitly enforces a minimum standard of
  [C11](https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/11)

## Features

- Find symmetry operations
- Identify space-group type
- Wyckoff position assignment
- Refine crystal structure
- Find a primitive cell
- Search irreducible k-points
